 * The above lines should be at the head of every tool because they ensure no
 * one can access your tool unless properly logged in. We have carefully worked
 * on making /Tools/ as secure as possible over HTTP and you can focus on
 * writing useful code for science!
 */

/**
 * This is a skeleton tool that does nothing but give you a starting place for
 * writing your own custom tools. /Tools/ work by first having /Tool/tools.php
 * scan for sub-folders in /Tools/. Each valid tool is a sub-folder of /Tools/
 * that contains a php script of the same name as the folder. For example,
 * /Tools/NewThing/NewThing.php is a valid tool script.
 *
 * All valid tools populate the tool selector dropdown menu. The code is written
 * so this 'Sample' tool doesn't show up.
 *
 * When somone picks a tool the primary script (e.g. '/Tools/NewThing/NewThing.php') is
 * included from within '/Tool/tools.php'. Essentially, anything you write on
 * your script runs as if it was running from '/Tools/tools.php'.
 *
 * If making a new tool copy the sample directory then rename the directory it
 * and it's corresponding script. For example, to '/New/New.php'.
 *
 * What you have access to in all tools
 *  - $_PATH
 *  - $_SETTINGS
 *  - customFunctions.php
 *  - $_DATA
 *    -- Alias for $_SESSION['admin']['{toolname}Data']
 *    -- This is a special holder array that you can use to store information
 *       into $_SESSION. I highly recommend you use $_DATA and not make your own
 *       holder in $_SESSION. By using $_DATA the session data you make will be
 *       wiped when the user logs out.
 *
 *  - Collector classes
 *    -- Any class in /Code/classes/ will be loaded once you attempt to make a
 *       new instance. For example, `$user = new User("mikey", $errors);` will
 *       cause the autoloader to `require "Code/classes/user.class.php"`.
 *
 *
 * General structure of page where your tool will be included:
 *
 * `<body id="flexbox">
 * `    <div id="nav">NavigationBar stuff</div>
 * `    ## ## YOUR TOOL IS INCLUDED HERE ## ##
 * `
 * `</body>
 *
 * The body ID is "flexbox" becasuse that is how the rest of the program is
 * configured but for /Tools/ we have changed that ID style to
 * { display: block; height: auto; } If you'd like to override that you can
 * simply add <style></style> tags inside your tools page and it will apply to
 * the display while your tool is in use.
 *
 * You can actually do things like set ID "nav" to width and height of 0 but we
 * advise heavily against it because people will not be able to logout or switch
 * tools after choosing yours.
 *
 * If you make something that feels like it will be useful for others then make
 * a pull request on the Github page https://github.com/gikeymarcia/Collector/
