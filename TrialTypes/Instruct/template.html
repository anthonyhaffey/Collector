<!--
WARNING!  Any changes you make to this Instruct trial type will not change
the experiment because there is another version of 'Instruct' within the
'/Experiments/_Common/TrialTypes/` folder.

This was done as an example of how you can copy trial types from
'/TrialTypes/' into '/Experiments/_Common/TrialTypes/' and override the default
trial display. This is a feature meant to keep all of your modification in
one place '/Experiments/'.

You can also make your own new trial types inside of the
'/Experiments/_Common/TrialTypes/' folder and will have access to them in your
experiment. The real benefit of developing experiments this way is that when
new versions of Collector come out with features you want you will be able to
download the new version and copy your /Experiments/ folder into the new
version so you can take advantage of new features without having to
completely port your experiment to the new version.
